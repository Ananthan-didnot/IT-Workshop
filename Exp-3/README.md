# Experiment 3: Create an image slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This experiment demonstrates how to build an interactive image gallery with slider functionality.

## Overview

In this experiment, we created an image gallery with the following features:
- Grid layout for thumbnail display
- Modal view for enlarged images
- Previous and next navigation controls
- Keyboard navigation support
- Smooth transitions and animations

## Implementation

The implementation is contained in a single HTML file that includes:
- HTML structure for the gallery and modal
- CSS styling for responsive layout and animations
- JavaScript for interactivity and navigation

## Key Features

- Click on any image to view it in a modal
- Navigate between images using arrow buttons
- Close the modal by clicking outside or pressing ESC
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the Exp-3 directory
3. Open index.html in your browser
4. Make sure the image files (1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc.) are in the same directory

## Preview

The gallery displays images in a grid, and when an image is clicked, it opens in a full-screen modal with navigation controls.
