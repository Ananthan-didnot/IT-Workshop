# Experiment 1: Create a web page and deploy on a local web server

This experiment demonstrates how to create a simple login page using HTML and CSS and deploy it on a local web server.

## Overview

In this experiment, we created a basic login form with the following features:
- Clean, responsive design
- Input fields for email and password
- Submit button with hover effects
- Proper HTML structure and CSS styling

## Implementation

The implementation consists of two main files:
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the login form
- `styles.css`: Contains all the styling for the login page

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the Exp-1 directory
3. Open index.html in your browser or set up a local server

## Preview

When properly rendered, the login form appears centered on the page with a clean white background and blue accent colors.
